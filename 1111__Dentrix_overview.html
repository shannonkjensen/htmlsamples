<h1>Dentrix overview</h1>
<p class="BodyText">Dentrix by Henry Schein One is a clinical and practice 
 management software system that helps you manage a wide range of practice 
 information, including patient demographics, clinical details, and production 
 analysis.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Dentrix software includes five main modules that 
 each manage specific types of information:</p>
<p class="BulletLevel1"><span style="font-family:&#39;Symbol&#39;">·</span><span style="word-spacing:normal; font:6.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Family File</span> - The Family File 
 module manages patient and insurance information. From this module you 
 will keep track of a patient's name, address, employer, insurance information, 
 notes, and continuing care, as well as other important information.</p>

<p class="BulletLevel1"><span style="font-family:&#39;Symbol&#39;">·</span><span style="word-spacing:normal; font:6.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Appointment Book</span> - Managing 
 appointments is easy with the Dentrix Appointment Book. The Appointment 
 Book offers goal-oriented scheduling with the flexibility to make one-time 
 changes. Appointment Book's convenient toolbars and Flip Tabs make navigating 
 through the Appointment Book, searching for open times, and organizing 
 appointments simple and quick. Appointment Book allows you to schedule 
 appointments, record broken appointments, print route slips, and dial 
 a patient's phone number directly from the computer. As with all the standard 
 Dentrix modules, the Appointment Book provides access to other Dentrix 
 modules from the toolbar.</p>

 Chart module manages the clinical information for patients. The Patient 
 Chart is a powerful, yet easy-to-use, application. The Chart allows you 
 to post existing, completed, and recommended procedures using common textbook 
 symbols. Additionally, the Chart helps users keep extensive and detailed 
 notes regarding patient care. Several sub-modules of the Chart help users 
 manage other clinical functions. The Presenter is a unique case presentation 
 program that displays the treatment plan costs in terms of primary and 
 secondary insurance portions and the estimated patient portion. The Perio 
 Chart is an unparalleled periodontal data maintenance tool.</p>

 managed in the Ledger. Because Dentrix is a seamlessly integrated system, 
 procedures completed in the Patient Chart are automatically posted in 
 the Ledger. All financial transactions are recorded in the Ledger, including 
 charges, payments, and adjustments. The Ledger provides information concerning 
 patient portion versus insurance portion, deductibles owed, and payment 
 arrangements.</p>

 Manager offers useful, customizable reports including day sheets, aging 
 reports, financial reports, patient lists, reference reports, and more.

 effective, professional-looking letters that are available at the click 
 of a mouse. These letters include welcome letters, congratulatory letters, 
 thank you letters, and a variety of appointment and continuing care (recall) 
 reminders, progress reports, and collection notices. The Office Manager 
 contains a set of utilities and commands that make customizing Dentrix 
 easy.</p>

<h2>Other Dentrix components and features</h2>
<p class="BodyText">In addition to the five main modules, Dentrix also 
 includes the following components and features:</p>
<p class="BulletLevel1"><span style="font-family:&#39;Symbol&#39;">·</span><span style="word-spacing:normal; font:6.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Perio 
 Chart -</span> The Perio module is one of the most comprehensive periodontal 
 charting software programs available. The Perio module allows you to record 
 Mobility, Furcation Grades, Plaque, Calculus, Bone Loss, Pocket Depths, 
 Bleeding and Suppuration points, Gingival Margins, CAL levels, and MGJ 
 measurements. Perio Chart data can be also be viewed graphically using 
 the Graphic Chart. You can also print custom reports, charts, and letters 
 for an insurance consultant or the referring dental professional.</p>
<p class="BulletLevel1"><span style="font-family:&#39;Symbol&#39;">·</span><span style="word-spacing:normal; font:6.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Document Center</span> - Document Center 
 helps you create a truly paperless office. Documents (such as patient 
 letters, EOBs, and referral letters) or images (such as patient pictures 
 and X-rays), can be scanned, captured, and imported. These documents can 
 be attached to patients, providers, insurance carriers, and referral sources. 
 The documents can also be attached to multiple sources for use as references, 
 or they can be printed, emailed, or sent electronically.</p>
<p class="BulletLevel1"><span style="font-family:&#39;Symbol&#39;">·</span><span style="word-spacing:normal; font:6.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Office Journal</span> - The Office 
 Journal can be accessed from all Dentrix modules, the Referral Analysis 
 screen, and certain lists including the Continuing Care List, ASAP List, 
 and Unscheduled List. Like a journal of your daily activities, the Office 
 Journal has two main functions: to keep a record of past events and remind 
 you of events in the future.</p>
<p class="BulletLevel1"><span style="font-family:&#39;Symbol&#39;">·</span><span style="word-spacing:normal; font:6.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Questionnaires</span> - The Questionnaires 
 module is one of the features in Dentrix that can help your office go 
 paperless. Questionnaires can store the same information that is included 
 on new patient forms, health history updates, and other forms used in 
 your office to collect information from patients. Plus, the Questionnaires 
 module allows you to create a custom set of questions for your patients 
 so that specific information can be stored in each patient's Dentrix file. 
 You can sign, date, and lock a questionnaire form to secure the information 
 contained therein. If you are using eCentral, you can upload questionnaires 
 to your practice website so that patients can access them from and fill 
 them out on any computer.</p>
<p class="BulletLevel1"><span style="font-family:&#39;Symbol&#39;">·</span><span style="word-spacing:normal; font:6.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Treatment Planner</span> - The Treatment 
 Planner is designed to bridge the gap between doctor and patient by providing 
 patients with easy-to-understand treatment options. When used in conjunction 
 with the Presenter tool, the Treatment Planner provides powerful case 
 presentations.</p>
<p class="BulletLevel1"><span style="font-family:&#39;Symbol&#39;">·</span><span style="word-spacing:normal; font:6.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Treatment Manager</span> - Many offices 
 spend a significant amount of money to attract new patients to their practice 
 as a means of increasing their overall revenue. Yet, most offices already 
 have a substantial amount of potential revenue sitting untouched in patient 
 treatment plans. Capitalizing on that revenue source can be a cost-effective 
 way to increase your practice's bottom line. The Treatment Manager helps 
 you take advantage of that potential income by allowing you to quickly 
 generate a contact list of patients who meet certain criteria specified 
 by you.</p>
<p class="BulletLevel1"><span style="font-family:&#39;Symbol&#39;">·</span><span style="word-spacing:normal; font:6.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Smart Image</span> - <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;
